  <p>With the advent of modern electronic information age and the continuous development of information technology, the realization of automation and intellectualization has become a trend of development in the current society. Intellectualization and automation technology have been paid more and more attention in the field of toy manufacturing. Intelligent voice interactive toys are the product of automation, and many toys have been realized in reality. This graduation project based on single-chip computer intelligent voice interactive toy system design. In order to make the whole system more secure and flexible and enhance the adaptability of the system, the system structure of intelligent voice interactive toy based on single chip computer is designed. The selected single chip computer is the core component of the system. Each sub-module of the system is controlled by single chip computer. The toy can realize the functions of forward, backward, left and right turn under the control of Bluetooth and voice. Add the anthropomorphic lamp array, flicker and switch by voice control.<br> One of the characteristics of intelligent voice interactive toys is voice interaction. Speech communication with machines to make them understand what you are saying is something people have long dreamed of. The image of the school-enterprise alliance of the Internet of Things in China has to compare speech recognition to “machine auditory system”. Speech recognition technology is a high technology that enables machines to convert speech signals into corresponding text or commands through the process of recognition and understanding. Speech recognition technology mainly includes feature extraction technology, pattern matching criteria and model training technology. Speech recognition technology has also been fully used in vehicle networking. For example, in wing truck networking, it is safe and convenient to set up direct navigation of destination only by pressing a button to communicate with customer service <a href="http://personnel.In" rel="nofollow">personnel.In</a> order to realize intelligent voice interactive toys, we need to use ld3320 speech recognition module. It supports SPI interface and parallel interface of non-specific speech recognition module, on-board middlehead and active crystal oscillator, and facilitates the realization of speech recognition, voice control and human-computer dialogue functions in electronic products. It has the following product characteristics:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>High accuracy and practical speech recognition effect.</li> 
   <li>Person-Independent Speech Recognition Technology: Users are not required to conduct recording training.</li> 
   <li>Dynamic editable list of recognition keywords: Just send the recognized keywords into the chip in the form of strings, which will take effect immediately in the next recognition. For example, in the programming of MCU such as 51, users simply set the registers of the chip and dynamically transfer the keyword recognition content such as “Hello” into the chip. The chip can recognize the keywords set in this way.</li> 
   <li>Support users to edit 50 keywords freely: at the same time, 50 keywords can be identified, and end users can edit and update the content of these 50 keywords at any time according to the needs of the scene.<br> The single chip computer used in this design is STM32F103ZET6. STM32F103ZET6, literally, ST is a Semiconductor of Semiconductor of Meaning, M is the abbreviation of Microelectronics, 32 stands for 32 bits. Together, STM32F103ZET6 is a 32-bit microcontroller developed by ST Company. ARM has launched its new 32-bit Cortex M3 microcontroller core based on ARMv7 architecture. Then ST (Italian Semiconductor) launched MCU-STM32F103ZET6 based on Cortex-M3 core. STM32F103ZET6, with its diversified product line, high cost-effective, simple and easy-to-use library development method, quickly emerged from many Cortex-M3 MCUs and became the most shining new star. As soon as STM32F103ZET6 came into the market, it quickly occupied the middle and low-end MCU market. STM32F103ZET6 belongs to a microcontroller. It has its own common communication interfaces, such as USART, I2C, SPI, etc. It can connect many sensors and control many devices. In real life, many electrical products we come into contact with are STM32F103ZET6, such as smart bracelets, micro four-axis aircraft, balance car, mobile POST machine, smart rice cooker, 3D printer and so on.This graduation project is only a general introduction of simple intelligent voice interactive toys. With the development of science and technology, intelligent voice interactive toys will develop towards the direction of high intelligence and high integration. We need to further improve the system, reduce costs, and integrate various technologies, such as biometric recognition technology, encryption technology, multi-functional modules, to achieve multi-standard coexistence, high-speed reading and writing and so on. Intelligent voice interactive toy system with low energy consumption .</li>
